# Image - Generation

- Image generation involves using computational methods, often based on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, to create new images.
- Various approaches, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), autoregressive models, transformers, and neural style transfer, enable the creation of images from scratch or based on specific inputs.
- These methods generate images by learning from existing data or predefined styles and can be applied across diverse fields like art generation, data augmentation, medical imaging, and more.
- The advancements in deep learning and neural network architectures have significantly enhanced the capabilities of image generation models, allowing them to produce realistic and diverse images.
